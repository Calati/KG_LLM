# 266_Final_Project
In this paper, we propose a novel methodology
that integrates Knowledge Graphs (KGs) with
Large Language Models (LLMs) to enhance
contextual reasoning in conversational recommender
systems (CRSs). By incorporating both
user preferences from conversational histories
and external metadata about movies, our approach
enables LLMs to perform knowledgeaware
reasoning on "hidden relationships" between
nodes in the graph, resulting in more relevant
recommendations and richer explanations.
Our empirical evaluation on a CRS benchmark
demonstrates the effectiveness of our method,
highlighting its potential to improve zero-shot
conversational recommendations and advance
personalized, real-time recommendation systems.
